Who Do I Pass The Ball To Next?

In every team sport or game, there is a notion of passing. Moving the focus from one player to the next. While it can be fast paced and look chaotic from afar, every pass from one player to another has a purpose and has likely been practiced hundred or thousands of times.  This is as true of baseball outfielders throwing the ball in to stop the play at home as it is of football players moving the ball toward the goal.  Knowing when and where to get rid of the ball is just as important as knowing when to hold the ball.
In project and process management this is also a very important concept. Knowing when to hand off a task to keep the game moving forward is just as critical as doing your assigned parts of the process to the best of your ability. However, this is an area where a lot of teams struggle. It is not that it is hard to know how to pass a task to the next relevant player, but most of the time project teams are not sure what to hand off to who, nor when exactly. This issue manifests itself in confusion, frustration and a perceived need for even more meetings to sort the details out at every juncture. 
Meetings do help solve things like this, so we retreat to the comfort of the known yet costly and ultimately inefficient model of 'more meetings' rather than dig into the root cause. Seeing meetings and the confusion of what forced yet another one as a symptom is the first step in treating the underlying disease. I believe that illness is caused by lack of project planning and mapping early on. Not understanding the flow of who ultimately gets to mark something done or how acknowledgment of a handoff should be conducted are at the core of the matter.  
Think about all the tasks currently on your plate. Do you know, without having to really think about it, what steps conclude your involvement? Who signs off that they are now taking responsibility for that work moving ahead? What is the process for marking it as 'done' in a clear and concise way that communicates it to the entire team? If you have an answer that comes to mind immediately for each and your team never has meetings to clarify any of those bits along the way, then congratulations, you are performing this aspect of team play extremely well.  For everyone else, read on.
The questions I asked in the previous paragraph are the exact ones that you should be asking yourself about any talk you are working on. Ideally you would be leveraging some form of ["responsibility assignment matrix"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) to give you a structure to default to when answering these questions. If you don't have such a formal model in place there are a simple practice you can adopt to sort this all out. It involves taking a little more time at the top of your project planning. Take the time to do a walk through of how the handoffs will work in an ideal set of circumstances pays.
Role playing through the scenario is one of the best ways to uncover points of confusion or friction in a low pressure environment. You will always end up hitting 'unknown unknowns' but being prepared for some expected scenarios will help everything move much smoother in real world scenarios.  This role playing should either be following a workflow chart your have pre-made or can be used as the very tool to build such documentation. Either way, what you discover along the way in this collaborative 'walk through' should be documented and the plan augmented to reflect what you have discovered.  
On a 'per task' level we can actually build in the needed information into our "Done" statement. I have spent a little time defining what I mean by this "Done" statement back in my post [The Value Of Defining Done](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/value-defining-done-dwayne-mcdaniel/)  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/value-defining-done-dwayne-mcdaniel/ and won't elaborate too much here on the general idea. This is an ideal place to define who the task is handed off to once the work is completed but before the card is closed.  
It is easy to mark something as 'done' on a Kanban or Scrum board, but making sure that the 'ball' gets passed to the right person at the right time takes planning. At first this will feel like a chore and a whole extra level of work as we work the muscle and start to build up that muscle memory of a new process. But once you work this part of planning into your team's rituals it will feel weird to not plan out those hand offs in advance. 
Working all this out does take some focus and effort on your team's part. The alternative is endless meetings, burnout from your bottlenecks and team confusion as you grow. Taking the time up front might feel like you are overplanning and stealing time away from getting 'real work' done. but of you have ever had work wasted or need to be redone due to internal miscommunications, then I think mapping this out ahead will ultimately save a great deal of time.   
You don't have to do this alone. Having a neutral third party observe and coach the team on how to better leverage your responsibility assignment matrix can really accelerate a team's adoption of better practices.
