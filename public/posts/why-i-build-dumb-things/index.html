                    <p>I like building dumb ideas out.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorites:</p>
<p><a href="https://csscms.club/">CSSCMS</a> - A static site generator based on stuffing everything we can into CSS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cleanandsoapbar.com/">Clean and Soap Bar</a> - A strange little joke on a website lending legitimacy to a company.</p>
<p><a href="https://amionlineornot.info">Am I Online Or Not Dot Info</a> - The most primitive example I could build of a microservice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kevinthull.com/">KevinThull.com</a> - A glorious inside joke in the Drupal community to build a GithubPage Kevin Thull himself can not open pull requests for.</p>
<p><a href="https://agilemarketing.biz">agilemarketing.biz</a> - My study notes while reading The Agile Marketer for a job I used to have.</p>
<p><a href="https://timisnotworthsaving.info/">Tim Is Not Worth Saving</a> - Another inside joke, this one from the WordPress community. A tongue in cheek reply to the <a href="https://savetimwithus.com/">Save Tim With Us site</a> which was itself an inside joke.</p>
<p>So why do I do it? I have been asking myself the same thing recently.</p>
<p>None of these ideas are in the least way profitable for me.
Likely, none of these are going to land me a job.
Only some of these projects taught me new skills, though it does help me sharpen some of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps my tech tinkering is a distraction from getting other things done that would bring me more income.  Maybe I am scared of success and this blog you are reading is just another example of me wasting time and talent by being in an IDE instead of engaging with other people.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/YouTooCanBeGuru">My friend Bridget</a> says it best, that &ldquo;Some people like computers because ones and zeros do what they are supposed to do when you tell them what to do, but people are unpredictable.&rdquo; Typing out words on a screen has the immediate feedback loop that gives me a quick hit of satisfaction that something has happened. Working with others takes much more patience, though the payoff is typically greater. But the downside to a little code not working is the joy of more effort to make it work. The downside of working with people is sometimes a crushing emotional toll.</p>
<p>Building random ideas that come into my head is fun. Making little inside jokes that only a few people will see has an immediate payoff that I don&rsquo;t need to maintain or explain further. It just is a little art project that maybe no one will ever even see.  Like this blog post.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t have a single answer to why I build dumb things. Maybe I need to work it out more talking to people rather than just writing about it, especially since I have slides to make and strategy work to work out.</p>
<p>But I have no real intention of stopping.</p>
