      <description>I like building dumb ideas out.
Here are a few of my favorites:
CSSCMS - A static site generator based on stuffing everything we can into CSS.
Clean and Soap Bar - A strange little joke on a website lending legitimacy to a company.
Am I Online Or Not Dot Info - The most primitive example I could build of a microservice.
KevinThull.com - A glorious inside joke in the Drupal community to build a GithubPage Kevin Thull himself can not open pull requests for.</description>

      <description>As I was on my way to PressNomics I was waylaid by the airline industry mismanagement of things and got stranded overnight in Denver. One of the best benefits of being as old as I am though is that I have made a lot of friends and acquaintances over the years pretty much all over the country and certain parts of the world. So, I thought &amp;ldquo;who do I know in Denver who might let me crash with them?</description>

      <description>You might be wondering why I built this site. And if you know me, you might be wondering why I am starting yet another blog. I hope to answer those fully in this first post and there are basically 2 main reasons.
1. I wanted to build a new site based on a static site generator I have been fascinated by JAMStack for a long while now. There is fundamental question about &amp;ldquo;do we need a DB for most use cases anymore?</description>
