						<div class="post-summary"><p>I took most of Veterans Day off. I did not serve in the military myself, instead doing civil service through Americorps, but I am grateful for those who did go off to war and defend the ideals I get to enjoy. I like to review history of service on this day. Learning from history will hopefully help us all avoid mistakes in the future. So I canceled all my meeting and dedicated some time to reflection.</p></div>

This was by far the largest virtual event I have taken part in and it was super well organized and flowed really well.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>I like building dumb ideas out.
Here are a few of my favorites:
CSSCMS - A static site generator based on stuffing everything we can into CSS.
Clean and Soap Bar - A strange little joke on a website lending legitimacy to a company.
Am I Online Or Not Dot Info - The most primitive example I could build of a microservice.
KevinThull.com - A glorious inside joke in the Drupal community to build a GithubPage Kevin Thull himself can not open pull requests for.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>As I was on my way to PressNomics I was waylaid by the airline industry mismanagement of things and got stranded overnight in Denver. One of the best benefits of being as old as I am though is that I have made a lot of friends and acquaintances over the years pretty much all over the country and certain parts of the world. So, I thought &ldquo;who do I know in Denver who might let me crash with them?</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>You might be wondering why I built this site. And if you know me, you might be wondering why I am starting yet another blog. I hope to answer those fully in this first post and there are basically 2 main reasons.
1. I wanted to build a new site based on a static site generator I have been fascinated by JAMStack for a long while now. There is fundamental question about &ldquo;do we need a DB for most use cases anymore?</p></div>
