            <div class="post-content">
                <p>You might be wondering why I built this site. And if you know me, you might be wondering why I am starting yet another blog. I hope to answer those fully in this first post and there are basically 2 main reasons.</p>
<h2 id="1-i-wanted-to-build-a-new-site-based-on-a-static-site-generator">1. I wanted to build a new site based on a static site generator</h2>
<p>I have been fascinated by <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> for a long while now. There is fundamental question about &ldquo;do we need a DB for most use cases anymore?&rdquo; that I have struggled with for a while now. A quick look see through my <a href="https://github.com/mcdwayne">GitHub account</a> will reveal a slew of things I have looked at, from flat HTML to GatsbyJS, both of which I run in production.</p>
<p>Nothing really seemed like the solution I was looking for for a new blog. NPM libraries for a site build kinda got me down to be honest.  Then, out of nowhere, this tweet I started down a rabbit hole from which this site was born:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="hugo--netlifyhttpsgohugoiohosting-and-deploymenthosting-on-netlify-is-freaking-awesome"><a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">Hugo + Netlify</a> is freaking awesome!</h3>
<p>First of all, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is based on the Go language, which is build from concept on up for scale and speed. As I dig into Hugo, I am learning more Go as I go along. That is not likely a bad thing.</p>
<p>Second of all, theming is downright fun. I am not even joking. I have delighted in figuring out the few things I have while overriding one of <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">the many themes you can get off the shelf</a>. Leveraging Bootstrap and very minimal JS makes this as fun to work on as old school Geocities in my opinion, but with plenty of room to get fancy if I need to. But I don&rsquo;t think I will need to, given the notion of this blog.</p>
<p>Deploying is also the same process as pushing to github. Unlike a few other projects I have tried where version control and deployments are not interdependent, the arrangement with Netlify means <code>git push origin master</code> is all I need to kick of the less than 30 second process to update my site.  I did investigate a 100% github based solution relying on Hugo&rsquo;s build process locally but it is not nearly as slick or simple as Netlify&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But maybe my favorite part though, is I am writing this post in Markdown, in my terminal while the hugo server is running and showing me the build every time I save the file. Below is a screenshot of how I made this post:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6z0eCtr.png" alt="screenshot of visual studio code open with 3 files open and a terminal running hugo server"></p>
<h2 id="2-i-need-a-place-to-organize-my-thoughts-outside-of-my-other-writing-projects">2. I need a place to organize my thoughts outside of my other writing projects</h2>
<p>Currently I have two ongoing writing projects for my current brands:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.mcdwayne.com/">Public speaker in the WordPress and Drupal communities, mcdwayne.com</a>, and</li>
<li>My newest outing, the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwaynemcdaniel/detail/recent-activity/posts/">LinkedIn blog for Process Digital Consulting</a></li>
</ol>
<p>My mcdwayne project started as a personal blog, but in late 2016 I realized I needed a way to track my life of constant travel to dozens of events per year. What it has become is a formulaic review of WordCamps and DrupalCamps so I can sort out in the future what I did at the 100+ events I have participated in since 2016.  There are a few personal posts tossed in but mostly I have kept the scope to my life working in the Drupal and WordPress space.</p>
<p>My blog for <a href="https://processdigitalconsulting.com">Process Digital Consulting</a> is a tool for me to sort through my thoughts on process management, with a goal of developing content channels from what I sort out. No real room there for personal thoughts that waft through my mind outside of the lense of process optimization.</p>
<p>This blog is meant to be my personal thoughts without binding it to what I do for a living. I felt I needed a place for random technology tinkering notes or crochet or whatever is on my mind in general.  This is what I used to use MySpace and Facebook for before one went away and I quit the other.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-will-i-update-what-will-i-write-about-next">How often will I update? What will I write about next?</h2>
<p>I have no idea about these questions right now. I did not intend to create a personal blog when I started, but the more I thought on it, the more I realized I wanted to do just that. I will be here writing and likely pushing out notices on <a href="https://twitter.com/McDwayne">twitter when I do update</a>.</p>
<p>Always happy to talk about just about anything, feel free to reach out.</p>
