<h2 id="a-new-blog-for-a-new-leg-of-my-journey">A new blog for a new leg of my journey</h2>
<p>I am super excited to write my first personal blog post about my experiences at a conference in my new industry: the first ever <a href="https://nextjs.org/conf/">NextJS Conference</a>! This was by far the largest virtual event I have taken part in and it was super well organized and flowed really well. While 70K had registered, I believe I saw one place that there were &lsquo;only&rsquo; around 2,300 on the Discord instance.</p>
<p>While I have ducked in and out of several virtual WordCamps and Drupal events over the last year, I have not been writing about them. Not even <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/">Midcamp</a>, which I helped organize. We were the first 100% virtual Drupal camp on earth I believe. If you want to read about my previous adventures,  you can check out <a href="https://mcdwayne.com">my previous event/travel blog</a> .</p>

<h2 id="no-in-person-stuff-but-discord-was-there-for-flavor">No in person stuff, but Discord was there for flavor</h2>
<p>As you can imagine, with this large of an event, there was a lot of chatter and conversations going on at once across dozens of Discord channels and Twitter.  I started following a number of folks on social media I met in the General and Introduction channels. Not quite the same as meeting and chatting in person for sure, but networking all the same.</p>
<p>There was also the traditional <a href="https://nextjs.org/conf/expo">&lsquo;Expo Hall&rsquo;</a> set up but with a one day event and so much to see I didn&rsquo;t get the chance to set up a demo or even interact with any of the vendors directly. This is concern to me as someone who loves event marketing. How can sponsors reap the benefits of foot traffic at such events? This is a hard question that I have not seen a compelling answer for just yet.  I will say however, I do plan on looking into the companies from that expo list that I do not yet recognize.  The JS space has a lot of players and it is good to have any kind of resource for who is doing what.</p>
<h2 id="so-many-talks-and-so-many-things-written-down">So many talks and so many things written down</h2>
<p>With over 60 talks scheduled for a one day event, of course it would be impossible to see everything. Good thing for us they are all recorded on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZEITHQ/videos">conference&rsquo;s Youtube channel</a></p>
<p>A quick note on style: If you were a reader of my previous event/travel blog you will know it is my preferred style to share my raw notes as well as a summary of what I generally took away from the sessions. I want to share as much of my experience as possible and this also makes it way easier for me to find notes on a subject later on. Not only is my site online, but also stored in MD files locally and grep is a magical tool. Raw Notes are labeled as such.</p>
<h3 id="keynote">Keynote</h3>

<a href="https://twitter.com/timneutkens">Tim Neutkens Head of Next.js at Vercel</a></p>
<p>I thought my sound was out for the first 10 seconds as they did a super slick polished video of Guillermo checking his phone, noticing we were there and then welcoming us to the conference. I really enjoyed the production value as well as the announcements he and his team made about Next.js 10, released the same day as the conference.  Biggest take aways are new auto optimizing Image to use instead of regular img, Internationalization tooling built in for domain routing and translation and the biggest add in my mind, the Web Vitals integration. You can read much more about these things on the <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10">Next.js release blog</a></p>
<p>Two data points that really stuck out to me were about updated site user patience stats and how much ecommerce has exploded recently. First. for every 10 milliseconds of load time, the average person is 1% more likely to leave. This is quicker pace than the old metric of &lsquo;1 second = 7% traffic loss&rsquo;. We are becoming more impatient it seems.  The other astounding number was that before Covid, ecommerce accounted for 16% of total retail sales. Last month it was 34% of that total.  So much has changed so fast.</p>

<h3 id="when-not-to-use-nextjshttpsnextjsorgconfspeakersjescalan"><a href="https://nextjs.org/conf/speakers/jescalan">When Not to Use Next.js</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jescalan">Jeff Escalante</a>
Hashicorp</p>
<p>I had a feeling after the first 10 minutes of this one that, as one commenter on the Discord chat put it, &ldquo;I bet the big reveal is there is never a good time not to use it.&rdquo; Turns out, no. There are some times when using it as a hammer is the wrong move. But with tooling this powerful, it is important to know what it is really good at before you can start quantifying use cases it is bad for.</p>
<p>The biggest take away from this talk was his perspective on how cloud vendor creep and data source creep are things that need addressed over time as a result of growth.  Tools like Next.js are built to deal with this. Turns out, if you need simplicity but don&rsquo;t need to scale and/or have no budget, maybe spending the cycles to leverage this power is too much. But you won&rsquo;t know unless you learn what it can do though.</p>
<p>Raw Notes:</p>
<p>How is he even giving this talk?</p>
<p>He has thought much about it</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s all about balance</p>
<p>one key philosophical idea</p>
<p>interesting features</p>
<p>Hybrid Architecture</p>
<p>a key aspect of nextJS philosophy</p>
<p>Frameworks tend to couple to one architecture</p>
<p>dynamic (WP, PHP, Rails)</p>
<p>Static (Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll)</p>
<p>People like to talk about this</p>
<p>Mullenweg vs Biilmann - Netlify conference</p>
<p>Both are blondish gents with beards, in front of decorative bookshelf</p>
<p>Next.js don&rsquo;t care (like the honey badger)</p>
<p>You can make static before deployment or you could make a dynamic page on every
load, depends on how you use NextJS</p>
<p>You can take a path in between extremes</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t @ me about caches, IT IS NOT binary static/dynamic</p>
<p>caching blurs it</p>
<p>caches are not easy to deal with</p>
<p>with nextjs this is not the case, DOM manipulation</p>
<p>but you are not calling the shots, like back with Backbone you had to write out
the dom interactions</p>
<p>React more declarative models,</p>
<p>There is caching happening, but there is no need to manually fuss with it</p>
<p>Hashicorp Multi Architecture (not a plug, no one asked him to drop this in)</p>
<p>On prem vs Cloud - analogy</p>
<p>Quickly on prem becomes mostly and clear cloud is the better approach</p>
<p>Used to be people deployed code to own servers, then amazon, but really
multiple other plays, more complex</p>
<p>Even if a company govern to make only one choice, M&amp;A gets the multi cloud
problem&hellip;</p>
<p>any sufficiently large company has to eventually deal with multiple cloud
vendors</p>
<p>Hashicorp tools can interface with all the cloud providers and only one single
set of tools/resources</p>
<p>that shift is how Hashi has succeeded</p>
<p>back to the point</p>
<p>dev -&gt; static/dynamic/etc</p>
<p>no longer have to logically make those splits and try to manage it</p>
<p>Next serves the same function as Hashi, one mental model to deal with multiple
ways to do apps</p>
<p>Hi team does Hashicorp websites</p>
<p>they are building 14 sites</p>
<p>diversity of different needs</p>
<p>docs, ot marketing, to conference websites</p>
<p>all unique site needs</p>
<p>across those sites a wide range of challenges</p>
<p>only 7 devs, for a very fast growing company</p>
<p>how they even keeping up?</p>
<p>share the most things they can between all the sites</p>
<p>shared platfrom approach</p>
<p>Shared - foundation, tooling, components, knowledge, dev resources</p>
<p>thousands of pages, public user profiles, custom search, custom content based
on user</p>
<p>OK, back to the talk, we drifted pretty far with basic concepts</p>
<p>the X for Everything problem</p>
<p>a pervasive issue in tech</p>
<p>Rails as example</p>
<p>Rails has &lsquo;everything you need&rsquo; example articles/posts he shows</p>
<p>Jamstack solves everything!</p>
<p>Where NextJS shines:</p>
<p>Flexibility, Scale, Active Maintenance</p>
<p>Where NextJS does not shine</p>
<p>Small, simple sites</p>
<p>No plans for aggressive growth and scale (the largest part of the internet,
super important)</p>
<p>not frequently updated/maintained</p>
<p>no need for react in the first place</p>
<p>but please experiment!</p>
<p>the line is drawn when people paying to do certain work,</p>
<p>ply it in the right way</p>
<p>next.js hybrid architectures, abstracts a level up</p>
<p>this is effective for high flex/scale</p>
<p>it is not the solution for all problems.</p>
<p>maybe not for small sites with no scale needs</p>

<h3 id="everything-is-a-cmshttpsnextjsorgconfspeakersjescalan"><a href="https://nextjs.org/conf/speakers/jescalan">Everything Is a CMS</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/seancdavis29">Sean C Davis</a></p>
<p>Of all the talks I saw that took full advantage of being recorded before hand, Sean took the possibilities the furthest.  I thought I had switched over to watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w">Polygon youtube written by Brian David Gilbert</a> for a moment. If there is higher praise I don&rsquo;t know how to bestow it.</p>
<p>This talk was a brilliant overview of the difference between API and Git based CMS approaches. Given that you can treat every data source imaginable as one or the other, so long as you ingest them through some ingestion layer, you can make anything a CMS! Even Trello! Even Google Sheets!  Not that you should.  But if you are in need of a good talk about how to evaluate CMS options, this is the best vid I have seen about that.</p>
<p>This talk also had the effect of making me order a sandwich for lunch.</p>
<p>Raw Notes:</p>
<p>Quirky funky intro, reminds me of BDG humor</p>
<p>SCD C makes his name totally unique</p>
<p>Ample - Cinci Ohio</p>
<p>does a lot of things with tech</p>
<p>the 29 comes from his birthday, leap day, 8 birthdays</p>
<p>Stella his dog</p>
<p>one talent, balance on her head</p>
<ol>
<li>How do we ge the right CMS</li>
</ol>
<p>How doe we minimize rework when making changes</p>
<p>considering Data source no matter what you choose</p>
<p>two types of CMS (ignorming the monoliths)</p>
<p>API driven or Git Based</p>
<p>Everything is how consumed and stored</p>
<p>API-Driven</p>
<p>data in the DB,</p>
<p>Content consumed by an API</p>
<p>Contentful, Agility, Dato, Sanity and even WP can do it</p>
<p>Git based</p>
<p>data stored in MD, YML, JSON, etc</p>
<p>Content is assumed by reading the data file</p>
<p>Forestly, NetlifyCMS</p>
<p>Prose sits above github</p>
<p>you can have people edit from withiin the repo</p>
<p>Choose the best tool fo the job, consider the requirements</p>
<p>There is a problem, NOT a productive way to work</p>
<p>WE generally get a set of preferred tools to solve most of the problems</p>
<p>Those don&rsquo;t solve every problem</p>
<p>Evaluate on preferred set of tools, choosing from prevetted tools</p>
<p>Evaluate?</p>
<p>Cost, Pricing model, Support, SLA, SSO, SDK</p>
<p>Type(Api vs Git)</p>
<p>Editing Experience</p>
<p>Preview-abilityy</p>
<p>publishing workflow/scheduling</p>
<p>single instance models</p>
<p>Localization</p>
<p>image transformation</p>
<p>Some unknowables</p>
<p>What is the editing experience</p>
<p>what is the dev experience?</p>
<p>Meet your editors where they already are</p>
<p>if using WP, just maybe leverage WP with your front end</p>
<p>you get new tool in your belt</p>
<p>What content management system</p>
<p>What if the best CMS is NOT meant to be a CMS</p>
<p>Trello, Asana, Jira,</p>
<p>Fauna, MongoDB, AWL</p>
<p>Spreadsheets? (DON&quot;T DO IT THOUGH)</p>
<p>Dropbox, Backblaze, Drive, etc</p>
<p>local apps or editors, files</p>
<p>MD, YML, Bear editor, VSCode</p>
<p>Sandwich time!</p>
<p>seancdavis/everything-is-a-cms on github</p>
<p>Contentful as the CMS -  sandwiches</p>
<p>drop pages in the pages directory,</p>
<p>demo of building simple page</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>until next project</p>
<p>now editors using Trello</p>
<p>talk to the Trello API instead of the Contentful API</p>
<p>works</p>
<p>but we duplicated code</p>
<p>separate repos</p>
<p>one file in example, silly</p>
<p>add it all up, so much to rewrite</p>
<p>eventually you would need to touch so many parts of an application</p>
<p>Data source are painful</p>
<p>How to minimize work on reworks?</p>
<p>Build an  engine that consumes data for your NextJS applications</p>
<p>drivers to support data sources</p>
<p>2 engines possible, file based and API based</p>
<p>wait, that is CMS&hellip;</p>
<p>API based transforms and makes available with REST or GraphQL</p>
<p>Better with working on dynamic/real-time data</p>
<p>File based pulls from various sources normalize it and write to files,</p>
<p>Great for static</p>
<p>example of workflow for the app</p>
<p>no perfect data source for your project</p>
<p>evaluate based on criteria important to you and your project to find a balance
between picking the best tool for the job and working efficiently</p>
<p>consider meeting your data and/or editors where they are, rather then moving
all content into a single source</p>
<p>You may have to swap out or add data sources, thats OK, build an engine that
processes and makes it less painful</p>
<p>no matter what though, remember above all else, have fun</p>

<p>(Simen Svale Skogsrud)[https://twitter.com/svale]</p>
<p>This seemed to be a &lsquo;sponsored session&rsquo; where we saw a demo of the new Sanity collaboration tools than a look at Real Time conceptually.  I have no issue with this, especially as it was a really well done demo. I walked away looking forward to testing Sanity.io and discussing it when the need for better content collaboration comes around on my team.</p>
<p>Raw Notes:</p>
<p>Simen, Knut (dev Rel), Espen(dev)</p>
<p>Sanity demo</p>
<p>Visual editor, easy to manipulate</p>
<p>rich text type editor, but just json under the hood, easy to conceptualize from
Dev perspective</p>
<p>no copy/paste weird markup - transportable as heck</p>
<p>Review changes are important</p>
<p>&lsquo;how can we know&rsquo; if reviewed changes?</p>
<p>Git diff like changes</p>
<p>Real time collaboration</p>
<p>see what others are doing</p>
<p>not messing around too much in production for this demo</p>
<p>ecommerce studio demo next</p>
<p>watching changes happen between viewers is powerful for collab</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/arunoda">Arunoda Susiripala</a></p>
<p>I was kinda hoping this would have been more about the theory behind learning things in general. While that was covered and did give me valuable insight into his thought process as a student and as a teacher, it seemed more a commercial for his React training materials. I guess I was hoping for a study on instructional design and delivery theory.  Still, his three reasons why something is hard is something I will be keep in mind as I write docs, guides and instructional materials from here on out and focus on the 20% critical points rather than boiling oceans.</p>

<p>blender FPS example - DAIN</p>
<p>he read whitepaper, math was beyond him</p>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s apply this to React</p>
<p>1 - need to understand JS and web basics</p>
<p>2 - confusing educational content - so many peices of content, not all good,
many outdated, hard to find good resources - using react classes vs hooks which
is modern</p>
<p>3 - React is not that complex but issue is to many tools in the ecosystem,
historical reasons obscure why you needed them, harder to learn alll the things</p>
<p>We need to understand 20% to get 80% done</p>
<p>We need a tutorial!</p>
<p>Just React course/tutorial</p>
<p>to get things done his way</p>
<p>deep dive on the first page, scares people</p>
<p>So many things you can learn about, where to start is the issue</p>
<p>diving into the most bare bones basics and moving from there</p>
<p>Next is practice</p>

<p>If there was one person I was going to see &lsquo;live&rsquo; at this event it was going to be one of the most awesome internet celebrities I follow on twitter. If you have not seen her amazing comedy video posts, you are missing out.  Turns out she is a great presenter too.  Something happened at some point in my note taking it it wiped out like the last 1/3 of my notes. That was the stuff with the code walk through and her awesome conclusion talking about how it is good to know CS basics when thinking through the logic of a problem, like she did with graphs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ZEITHQ/videos">Ya know what, just go watch this one. I will wait.</a></p>
<p>Raw Notes:</p>
<p>Working at Netlify</p>
<p>Choose your own adventure books for inspirations</p>
<p>Picking a data structure</p>
<p>Linked List?  No cause it is not linear</p>
<p>Trees?</p>
<p>Branching and so many choices</p>
<p>BUT CYO adventures are not always in one direction</p>
<p>branches converge</p>
<p>Graph?</p>
<p>Any which way you want to go you navigate bouncing around</p>
<p>but we want to have specific paths</p>
<p>no undo button overuse, want to be specific</p>
<p>Directed Graph</p>
<p>graph with arrows,</p>
<p>state machine, never in multiple states at once</p>
<p>&ldquo;user input driven state machine&rdquo;</p>
<p>now pick tools</p>
<p>XState  - state machine lib</p>
<p>reducers</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>React</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NextJS</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>add crowdsourcing</p>
<p>Netlify forms</p>
<p>HTML + data=true - Netlify picks it up with a function</p>
<p>Hasura for the DB</p>
<p>and a spooooky story</p>
<p>Demooooo!</p>
<p>So much cool code.</p>
<p>notes missing and conclusion oh no!</p>

<p>Now normally, if I don&rsquo;t get to see the whole session I don&rsquo;t include it.  But this time, I am because the reason I didn&rsquo;t see the end should be shared. Lesson learned here: if you are watching a youtube live presentation and are a bit behind, when the live broadcast ends, so does your access to that vid.  Now, they did post it later but it was a jarring experience and I will avoid being behind on the last session from now on.</p>
<p>What I did see though was interesting look at how to leverage Next.js and MongoDB, which I have never used before.  The examples were getting pretty deeply technical when it cut out. One to go back and rewatch later I guess.</p>
<p>Raw Notes:</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t like slides but</p>
<p>Why did devs like NextJS?</p>
<p>SSG and SSR?</p>
<p>Zero Config</p>
<p>File system routing</p>
<p>API Endpoints to expose backend functionality</p>
<p>no one in isolation</p>
<p>it is something more</p>
<p>Related to the Dunning Krueger effect</p>
<p>Seems to know a lot, powerful, rock star from the initial look at the tutorial</p>
<p>then build real thing and feel dumb</p>
<p>then work through it and learn what you need</p>
<p>NextJS is a rare framework that is complex but so much attention to dev
experience, it is suberb</p>
<p>easy to master and extend</p>
<p>MongoDB Atlas</p>
<p>not just a cloud DB</p>
<p>Atlas provides Lucene search</p>
<p>Serverless</p>
<p>Multicloud env.</p>
<p>code example</p>
<p>the app - property booking</p>
<p>connect booking to MongoDB</p>
<p>search and find experience for end user</p>
<p>and then it ends???</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>I had a great but exhausting time in this surprisingly short but jammed packed conference. The whole experience was only 5 hours, but it was a non-stop as fast as you could go 5 hours.  It informs me that online conferences can do more in smaller time frames than traditional conferences but the experience is so vastly different to the in person ones. I can&rsquo;t imagine going at this break neck speed if physically there, as there were no breaks, just &lsquo;bam&rsquo; &lsquo;bam&rsquo; &lsquo;bam&rsquo; all day.  But for some reason this worked out well online and I felt engaged the whole time.  I would 100% attend again!</p>
